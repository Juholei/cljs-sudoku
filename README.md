# Sudoku implemented in ClojureScript

* Using Reagent
* Logic behind is based on the [sudoku project](https://iloveponies.github.io/120-hour-epic-sax-marathon/sudoku.html) in [this Clojure MOOC](http://mooc.fi/courses/2014/clojure/)
    * My implementation of those exercises is [here](https://github.com/Juholei/sudoku)
